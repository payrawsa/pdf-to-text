First you need to have python 3.11 installed or higher
Then you need to have pip install as well
Both need to work from command line. I recommend git bash if you don't have it for command line
Then you run from command line pip install -r required.txt
Then you will replace hadith.pdf with your file 
Then you will run the program using python main.py
It will ask you for your file name for example: hadith.pdf
Then it will ask for the max number of pages. Meaning until what page of the pdf.
Max number should not be greater than size of pdf
wait until it finishes
Your file will be in the output folder
